Testing terminology

After compiling and running the program, it has resulted in a failure as it has failed one of its functional requirements. 
As a failure has been detected, a defect has been raised.
The bug which causes the failure is found in the roundHalfDown method. It results in numbers ending with .5 to be rounded incorrectly.
This bug is evidence of a fault in the roundHalfDown method.
The fault is that a parameter given to the setDecimalsPrecision method is incorrect.
The error is a result of the programmer having used BigDecimal.ROUND_HALF_UP as a parameter for setDecimalsPrecision(); whereas BigDecimal.ROUND_HALF_DOWN
should have been used instead.
